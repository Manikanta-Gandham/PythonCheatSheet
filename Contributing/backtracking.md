# Subsets

Subsets are the collections of elements from a given set, where the order of elements doesn't matter. Every set has at least two subsets: the empty set and itself. The number of subsets of a set with 
n elements is pow(2,n)
 . Subsets can contain any number of elements from zero to the total number of elements in the original set

 


# Permuations

Permutations are the arrangements of elements of a set in a particular order. The order of the elements matters in permutations.The number of permutations of a set of 
n elements taken r at a time is denoted by P(n,r)


# Combinations

Combinations are selections of items from a larger group, where the order doesn't matter. The number of combinations of a set of n elements taken 
r at a time is denoted by C(n,r)
